# Vue Mac Calculator
A simple macOS calculator made in VueJS.  
Check it out: https://vuecalc.cf, or alternatively [Vue Mac Calculator](https://vue-calc-3000.web.app/).

### Note: After testing Github actions a lot by tweaking everything in this calc, the layout is somehow skewed, not like the original. The screenshot of the original look is given below
